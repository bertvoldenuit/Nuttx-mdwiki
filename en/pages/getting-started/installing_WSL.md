# Installing a Linux Virtual Machine on Windows
=============================

The easiest way of installing Linux on a PC is by installing it on a Virtual Machine. The drawback is that it is much slower than if it is installed natively. However, there is no need of a fast Operating System to work with Nuttx. The most demanding softwares are text editors and source code compiler. The advantage there is no risk of screwing up your computer trying to fit two OS with dual boot, etc... Plus, installation and uninstallation are pretty easy as it’s like removing a program and doesn’t affect anything with boot loaders.

Let's get started!
