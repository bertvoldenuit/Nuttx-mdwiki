# RTOS exercices

First of all, the following exercices are based on the ```Real-time Operating Systems Book 2 - The Practice, by Jim Cooling```. For the exercices, a STM32F4Discovery (STM32F407VG) will be used. The only things needed are the 4 leds present on the board. Any other boards can be used by wiring properly 4 leds to it.

Reading ```Real-time Operating Systems Book 1 - The Theory, by Jim Cooling``` is essential to understand RTOS concepts which are not meant to be explained here.
